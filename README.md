# Chair Configurator

An interactive 3D chair customization tool built using modern web technologies. This project allows users to explore and configure different chair options dynamically while integrating smooth animations for an immersive experience.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic 3D Product Customization**:
  - Change materials and colors for the chair.
  - Real-time updates with React-Three-Fiber.
- **Smooth Animations**:
  - GSAP for scroll-based animations and transitions.
- **Optimized Performance**:
  - Built with Vite for fast development and optimized production builds.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - A seamless experience across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/):** For building the user interface.
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):** For a blazing-fast development environment and build tool.
- **[React-Three-Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction):** For integrating Three.js into React.
- **[GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/):** For animations and scroll-triggered effects.
- **[SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/):** For styling the application with modular and maintainable CSS.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm installed globally

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/barisGultekin/chair-configurator.git
   cd chair-configurator

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

3. Run the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev

## How it works

1.	3D Rendering:
- Uses React-Three-Fiber to create and render a 3D scene.
- Chair models and materials are loaded dynamically for real-time customization.
  
2.	Scroll-Based Animations:
- GSAPâ€™s ScrollTrigger syncs user scroll events with animations for an interactive experience.

3.	Styling:
- SCSS ensures modular and reusable styling for easy maintenance.
